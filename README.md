# Dagchain

## Quick Install

`pip install dagchain`

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is a proof of concept repo for vectorstore loader orchestration â’¸.
It combines [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with [Dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started).

## âœ… Run an example

We have created an example to show how to get started with this.

1. Clone this repo
2. Go into repository for examples `cd examples`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable `export OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}`
5. Run `make local-ingest` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the dag jobs you have created.See alternative storage options below.
6. Run `make local-run` to interact with a langchain agent using the local vectorstore.

To edit ingest and run files you should only need to update the examples/{storage_type}/ingest.py and examples/{storage_type}/query.py files. Right now for local storage I have set up two dags that leverage common loading logic. To add a new loader run simply create new document loader and set it up in the examples/main.py file using dagchain.
   i. You can use any Langchain [Document Loaders](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/document_loaders.html) to load your own data.


## Storage

### Pinecone
To run with Pinecone Vector Database you will need to:
1. Sign up for an account here: [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
2. Navigate to API Key page and set two environment variables `export PINECONE_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}` and `export PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT={YOUR_ENVIRONMENT}`
4. Run `make pinecone-ingest` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the dag jobs you have created.
5. Run `make pinecone-run` to interact with a langchain agent using the pinecone vectorstore.

## Future

This can be used to replace the manual run of `ingest.sh` in [ChatLangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain) to provide scheduled updates of vectorstores as well as handling and managing inputs from various sources.
